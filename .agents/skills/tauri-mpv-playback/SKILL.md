# Native libmpv playback

Canonical documentation:
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) § Playback
- [.agents/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) § Native playback invariants

## mpv options and contracts

- Core options remain valid and tested: `vo=gpu-next`, `keep-open=yes`, `idle=yes`, `hwdec`, `tone-mapping`, and `demuxer-lavf-o=strict=-2`.
- Stream changes own replacement: start the new session directly and let the session lifecycle stop the outgoing one (prevents race conditions).
- Relative recording paths resolve below Downloads.
- Headers are converted only through the safe mpv option helper.
- Do not use window shadows over the transparent player surface.

## Native setup

- `build.rs` discovers platform libmpv files.
- On Windows, `npm run setup:mpv` provisions the pinned development archive.
- On macOS, the build locates Homebrew’s libmpv installation.

## Verification and testing

```bash
npm run test:rust
npm run cargo-check
npm run check
```

Manually test the following matrix when playback paths change:
- stream start/stop
- seek
- tracks
- fullscreen
- recording
- replacement
- resize
- close
